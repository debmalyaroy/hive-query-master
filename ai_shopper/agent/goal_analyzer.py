    Decomposes the user's high-level shopping goal into specific, actionable sub-tasks.
    For example, "I'm going on a 5-day trek in the Himalayas near Manali next month.
    My budget is ₹40,000. I need all the essential gear. I prefer sustainable brands
    and I already have hiking socks. Get me the best options."
    could be broken down into:
    - Research essential gear for a 5-day Himalayan trek (Manali region).
    - Identify sustainable brands for hiking gear.
    - Find hiking boots suitable for Himalayan terrain (excluding socks).
    - Find a weather-appropriate jacket.
    - Find a 40-50L backpack.
    - Select necessary accessories (e.g., water bottle, headlamp), excluding socks.
    - Ensure total cost is within ₹40,000.
    - Prioritize best quality/reviews.
